    "- Computing bias is a bias that exists within algorithms that unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups, creating unfair outcomes\n",
    "- Computing innovations reflect biases because algorithms and data are influenced by the people who contributed to it, so computing biases can be embedded at every level of development \n",
    "- Algorithm bias should be reduced so computer innovations can combat existing user bias\n",

    "## Types of Computing Bias - Trevor\n",
    "Computing bias can be either intentional or unintentional and as said before, this bias is a result of human biases in development. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data bias: when the data set does not reflect the real world values\n",
    "    - Ex: A company is developing an algorithm to see whether or not a product has positive or negative online reviews. However, the training data might over-represent overly negative or positive opinions that are posted online which wouldn’t reflect the real-world popularity of the product\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Bias-Meaning.png\">\n",
    "- Human bias: People who make the programs may bring in their own biases whether consciously or unconsciously\n",
    "    - Ex: A software development team is working on a code review algorithm. They all have experience using Language X and so they believe that developers using Language X are more qualified and so their algorithm reflects that. This uses their individual traits and applies it to the entire group of coders using Language X.\n",
    "- Algorithmic bias reflects the data bias and human bias and often amplifies it. However, bias can arise from the structure and decision making of the program itself\n",
    "    - Ex: A program is designed to automate the loan approval system. It uses information from income, employment history, and credit score. However, the algorithmn can produce biased results based on trends from certain job occupations which may disproportionally affect certain groups\n",

    "- Obtain more diverse data (ex: racist computer)\n",

    "## More Mitigation Strategies: - Aditya\n",
    "Post-processing: This type of strategy is comprised of 3 parts, input correction, classifier correction, output correction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Correction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What it is: Imagine you have a machine learning model that identifies objects in images. Input correction involves making adjustments to the images used to test the model after it has already been trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If the model was trained mostly on pictures taken during the day, input correction might involve adjusting the brightness and color balance of images taken at night to make them more comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classifier Correction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What it is: This step focuses on fine-tuning the algorithm or model after training to reduce any biases or discrimination it might have inadvertently learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you have a model for hiring decisions, and you notice it tends to favor certain demographics. Classifier correction could involve tweaking the decision-making rules to ensure fair treatment for all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Correction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What it is: After the model makes predictions, output correction involves modifying those predictions to eliminate any biases or unwanted discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If a language translation model tends to produce more errors when translating sentences from one language to another, output correction might involve adjusting the final translated sentences to be more accurate and fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, post-processing is like a three-step check and adjustment process to ensure that a machine learning model behaves fairly and accurately, even after it has been trained. Input correction modifies the testing data, classifier correction fine-tunes the model, and output correction adjusts the final predictions. This helps in addressing issues like biases and discrimination that may arise during the model training process.\n",

    "Provide a solution to how this situation can be resolved, and how the computing bias can be removed. Explain which method of mitigation you will use and how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to ensure that the poeple represented to the algorithim are diverse in order to maximize equality. You can also check the algorithim by asking people who would be effected by a racist AI how they feel about it. Based off of this you can tweak the model. This can migitate racial bias. "
