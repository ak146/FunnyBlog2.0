    "\n",
    "- An decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct number for all inputs (eg: is the number even) (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.1)\n",
    "- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorith can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.2) An undecidable problem may have some instances  that have an algorthimic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem."

    "The Halting Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem in computer science, formulated by Alan Turing in the 1930s. It addresses the fundamental question of whether a program, given any input, will eventually halt (terminate) or run indefinitely (enter an infinite loop).\n",

    "        - The Entscheidungsproblem, or Decision Problem in English, was a question in the field of mathematical logic posed by David Hilbert in 1928. It asked whether there exists a general algorithm to determine the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. This question led to important developments in the study of computability and laid the groundwork for the field of theoretical computer science.\n",

They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem. This was proven by Alan Turing's \"Turing Machine\" which was created in the 1930s."
