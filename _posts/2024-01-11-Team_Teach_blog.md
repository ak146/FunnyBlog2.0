## Things I did

# Binary Project
- I worked on converting words from binary. I did this by utilziing ASCII. In order to convert text into binary, you must first convert each letter into its ASCII value. For example, A is 65. You must then convert this decmimal value into binary. Here are short mini games to help you through the process.
