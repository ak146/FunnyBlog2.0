# Summary

## Completed
- [Developing Algorithims](https://ak146.github.io/FunnyBlog2.0//2023/10/05/CSP-Algorithms-P2-2_IPYNB_2_.html)
## TEAM TEACH REVIEW
- We did not perform as well as expected. We switched around roles last minute. This left me confused as to what I was presenting. We went on too long and started off too advanced for our audience. In the future we need to ease our audience slowly into out topic

# Plans
- Finish up the Front End page: Get the buttons working so that it goes from homepage to rules to about. Add a start button. 
- Need to add a timer to the game for JS code and make it end the game when conditions are met.
