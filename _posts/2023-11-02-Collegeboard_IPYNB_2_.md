# Summary


## Things to study
- Pseudo code is slightly different than actual code
- make sure I read what each function does. 
- encoding 
- 29 is confusing?
- I have a lot of work to do when it comes to reading pseudo code. 
- next time it might be a good idea to use paper to visualize the code
- open standards?
