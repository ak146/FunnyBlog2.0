Daniel:I think that I got a 3.8 on my test because I did all of the required hacks. For example, in the JS debugging page I did all of the required edits and fixes to the given code and did the challenge code. However, I also think that I got more than a 0.9 because our team changed the code so that it would relate to our passion project. Our passion project will be similar to a popular game called geoguesser so we made our code relate to that by adding code relating to different countries. For example, in the JS debugging challenge hack, instead of calculating the total cost of food, it would calculate the total population of three different countries.

Saaras: I think that I got a 3.85 on my test, because I did all of the required hacks I was assigned to do, I also took it upon myself to make a new JavaScript object with all the countries, for our future project geogussr. By assigning values to each so that eventually we can make it a functual game using potentially pygame.

Will: I think I got a 3.9 on my test because I did all the required hacks and I helped out andrew. I also took it upon myself to create an interactive button which we can directly use to train for our game and use for future projects. This required using DOM in order to have an interactive element and including javascript to alternate betweent eh links. I also helped Andrew Kim to explain part of the hack and other members.

Andrew: I think I got a 3â€™8. I completed all the required hacks and learned how to create an html with links. I also learned how to change the style of fonts into italics and bold. I added links related to our GitHub and added sources for our geoguesser passion project

Ryan: I think I got a 3.8, since I got all the required hacks done, and helped daniel set up utterances. I further customized the javascript portion of the web programming, and made a optimized version of the code specialized for the specific population for each country.
