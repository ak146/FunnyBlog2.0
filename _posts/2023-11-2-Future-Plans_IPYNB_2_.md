# Summary
- This trimester I learned about the importance of team. Throughout the year I had many days where I could not commit as much as I would like to due to volleyball. My teammates were able to help me catch back up and when they needed help, I was able to help the. I helped Ryan and Daniel make the game in JS.
- I also learned about many different coding languages. My biggest weakness is Python. I learned Java first which made it hard to relearn the precise syntax. In the future, I will focus more on my Python so I can become a more diverse and versatile coder. I was very limited to JS and HTML this trimester.
- Another big weakness that I had was presenting. I was never the main speaker in any of our presentations and when I did speak I often stuttered and forgot my pieces. I feel like this is a big area of growth for me as I have struggled with it for many years.
