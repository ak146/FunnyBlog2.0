## Create your own GitHub Pages Project
> Make you own project from GitHub Pages Student Repo.

## Make a GitHub Pages Repository
> Goto GitHub [student](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student).

- Reference: [Create from template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Most student will pick this option.


- Reference: [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).  Student in CSA that teacher has asked to contribute to student example repo will pick this.


## Start the GitHub Pages Student Project
> Run the following commands using terminal on you machine.  Be sure Repo has been forked.

- Clone and Open project in VSCode
- Change "forkme" text with your "ghid" or selected location


```bash
(base) id:~$ mkdir vscode # make a vscode directory, if you don't have one
(base) id:~$ cd vscode # change to the directory
(base) id:~$ git clone https://github.com/forkme/student.git # change to your repo
(base) id:~$ cd  student  # change to the project directory
(base) id:~$ code . # open VSCode in project directory
```

Later, there may be interest in AWS Toolkit or Deploy extensions.  We will learn more about Marketplace Extensions as we do more.

## Hacks
> Setup Tools and test GitHub connection. Tool and Equipment setup is like attendance, without Tools and Equipment you are effectually absent.
- Change index.md to show it is REALLY YOURS.  Refer to [Markdown Cheet Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
    - Push a minor "index.md" change and Verify on GitHub [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support)
    - Verify "index.md" change on deployed GitHub Pages
