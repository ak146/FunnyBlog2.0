```python

```

### Problem 1
- Two airplanes are in a race, your job is to make a plane name list, append the name value to the participents  then make a variable that pulls the distance covered for each plane. in the end, in the curly brackets print the name of the plane, add more variables with curly brackets. 


```python
# Define a list of airplane race participants
participants = [
    {"name": "Billium Bang", "plane": "Red Rocket", "distance_covered": 1200},
    {"name": "Bushawn Bal", "plane": "The Biggest Bird", "distance_covered": 1500}
]

planes = []

# Calculate the total distance covered by each pilot during the race
for participant in participants:
    name = participant["name"]
    plane = participant["plane"]
    distance_covered = participant["distance_covered"]
    
    # Append the name of the plane to the 'planes' list
    planes.append(plane)
    
    # Print information about each participant using f-strings
    print(f"{name} flew the '{plane}' and covered a distance of {distance_covered} miles.")

# Determine the winner
winner = max(participants, key=lambda x: x["distance_covered"])
print(f"The winner of the airplane race is {winner['name']} in the '{winner['plane']}' with a distance of {winner['distance_covered']} miles!")

# Additional information about the planes
print("Additional information about the planes:")
for plane in planes:
    print(f"The '{plane}' is an impressive aircraft.")

```

    Billium Bang flew the 'Red Rocket' and covered a distance of 1200 miles.
    Bushawn Bal flew the 'The Biggest Bird' and covered a distance of 1500 miles.
    The winner of the airplane race is Bushawn Bal in the 'The Biggest Bird' with a distance of 1500 miles!
    Additional information about the planes:
    The 'Red Rocket' is an impressive aircraft.
    The 'The Biggest Bird' is an impressive aircraft.


### Problem 2
- Add more participants , in the loop, add a tricks variable that gets data from participants list
    score = tricks * 10  # Each trick is worth 10 points
    add a score and add it to a score in the list ex list[score] = score


```python
# Define a list of dog show participants
participants = [
    {"name": "Fido", "breed": "Golden Retriever", "tricks": 4},
    {"name": "Doggo", "breed": "Labrador Retriever", "tricks": 7},
    # Add more dog participants here
    {"name": "Rex", "breed": "German Shepherd", "tricks": 5},
    {"name": "Buddy", "breed": "Poodle", "tricks": 6}
]

# Calculate the scores for each dog based on the number of tricks they can perform
for participant in participants:
    tricks = participant["tricks"]
    score = tricks * 10  # Each trick is worth 10 points
    participant["score"] = score  # Add the score to the participant dictionary

# Determine the winning dog
winner = max(participants, key=lambda x: x["score"])

# Display the dog show results
print("Dog Show Results:")
for participant in participants:
    print(f"{participant['name']} the {participant['breed']} scored {participant['score']} points!")

print(f"The winner of the dog show is {winner['name']} with {winner['score']} points!")

```

    Dog Show Results:
    Fido the Golden Retriever scored 40 points!
    Doggo the Labrador Retriever scored 70 points!
    Rex the German Shepherd scored 50 points!
    Buddy the Poodle scored 60 points!
    The winner of the dog show is Doggo with 70 points!


this problem, were making a bank account, you just have to know what to do to add all of the functions to change the variables


```python
# Define a class representing a Bank Account
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder, balance=0):
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print(f"Insufficient funds. Cannot withdraw ${amount}.")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Account Holder: {self.account_holder}, Balance: ${self.balance}"

# Create two bank accounts Alex with 1000$ initially, and Noah with 5$ initially:
alexAccount = BankAccount("Alex", 1000)
noahAccount = BankAccount("Noah", 5)

# Perform some transactions:
alexAccount.withdraw(alexAccount.get_balance())  # Withdraw all money of Alex
noahAccount.deposit(alexAccount.get_balance())    # Give it all to Noah
noahAccount.withdraw(noahAccount.get_balance())    # Noah withdraws all of his money

# Display account information
print("Alex Account:", alexAccount)
print("Noah Account:", noahAccount)

```

    Withdrew $1000. New balance: $0
    Invalid deposit amount.
    Withdrew $5. New balance: $0
    Alex Account: Account Holder: Alex, Balance: $0
    Noah Account: Account Holder: Noah, Balance: $0


### add more regions



```python
import random

# Define a list of regions, each represented as a dictionary
regions = [
    {
        "name": "Region A",
        "GDP_growth": random.uniform(0.5, 3.0),
        "unemployment_rate": random.uniform(3.0, 10.0),
        "investment_score": random.uniform(50, 100),
        "education_index": random.uniform(0.5, 1.0),
        "infrastructure_quality": random.uniform(3.0, 8.0)
    },
    {
        "name": "Region B",
        "GDP_growth": random.uniform(0.5, 3.0),
        "unemployment_rate": random.uniform(3.0, 10.0),
        "investment_score": random.uniform(50, 100),
        "education_index": random.uniform(0.5, 1.0),
        "infrastructure_quality": random.uniform(3.0, 8.0)
    },
    {
        "name": "Region C",
        "GDP_growth": random.uniform(0.5, 3.0),
        "unemployment_rate": random.uniform(3.0, 10.0),
        "investment_score": random.uniform(50, 100),
        "education_index": random.uniform(0.5, 1.0),
        "infrastructure_quality": random.uniform(3.0, 8.0)
    }
    # Add more regions here as needed
]

# Define weights for each economic indicator
weights = {
    "GDP_growth": 0.4,
    "unemployment_rate": -0.2,
    "investment_score": 0.3,
    "education_index": 0.1,
    "infrastructure_quality": 0.2
}

# Function to calculate a score for each region based on economic indicators and weights
def calculate_score(region):
    score = 0
    for indicator, weight in weights.items():
        score += region[indicator] * weight
    return score

# Find the region with the highest economic growth potential
best_region = max(regions, key=calculate_score)

# Display information about the winning region
print(f"The region with the highest economic growth potential is {best_region['name']}:")
print(f"- GDP Growth Rate: {best_region['GDP_growth']:.2f}%")
print(f"- Unemployment Rate: {best_region['unemployment_rate']:.2f}%")
print(f"- Investment Score: {best_region['investment_score']:.2f}")
print(f"- Education Index: {best_region['education_index']:.2f}")
print(f"- Infrastructure Quality: {best_region['infrastructure_quality']:.2f}")

```

### problem final

- make an empty list and dictionary
- add data in all of the given simple loops, so that this problem runs its print functions without error
- this one is hard, try very hard, a heartfelt atempt, like all of the code done with minor issues is still full credit

try to understand this problem, it has lots of data abstractions

data is given on the bottem and a function is calling it IMPORTANT!!!



```python
def simulate_data_structure(data):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store city data
    city_data = {}

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store city statistics
    city_stats = {}

    for person in data:
        name = person["name"]
        age = person["age"]
        city = person["city"]

        # 1. Create a dictionary of city data
        if city not in city_data:
            city_data[city] = {"names": [], "total_age": 0, "total_people": 0}

        city_data[city]["names"].append(name)  # Add the name to the city's list
        city_data[city]["total_age"] += age  # Add the age to the city's total age
        city_data[city]["total_people"] += 1  # Increment the total people count

    for city, city_info in city_data.items():
        # 2. Calculate the average age for each city
        average_age = city_info["total_age"] / city_info["total_people"]
        city_info["average_age"] = round(average_age, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places

        # 3. Create a dictionary for city statistics
        city_stats[city] = {
            "total_people": city_info["total_people"],
            "average_age": city_info["average_age"]
        }

    # Add the city statistics under the "Statistics" key
    city_data["Statistics"] = city_stats

    return city_data

# Example data
data = [
    {"name": "William cheng", "age": 25, "city": "New York"},
    {"name": "Ryan Liao", "age": 30, "city": "Los Angeles"},
    {"name": "Saaras Kodali", "age": 22, "city": "New York"},
    {"name": "Daniel Lee", "age": 35, "city": "Los Angeles"},
    {"name": "Andreww Kim", "age": 28, "city": "Chicago"},
]

result = simulate_data_structure(data)
print(result)
