## Review Ticket
> linux interaction:
Linux shell and Bash commands are important tools for using the terminals efficiently. They offer a far more efficient way of navigating the Linux operating system. They can perform various tasks that can help boost your speed and accuracy when coding. Some examples of linux and bash commands are: LS: used to list files and directories, helping the user see availability. Cd changes the working directory to one of your choice allowing for quick and easy movements between files and folders. Mkdir is one of the fastest ways to create new directories and cp/mv/rm all allow for efficient file manipulation like moving, copying, and deleting files. These commands, among many others, provide users with a versatile toolkit to efficiently perform tasks and manage their Linux systems from the command line.

- mkdir: creates a directory
- cd: changes the directory
- echo: echoes a string that you type
- make: runs the makefile and compiles the code.
